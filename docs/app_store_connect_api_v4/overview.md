## Important Notes

> **Important**: Changes you make using the App Store Connect API affect the production data you use for development and distribution.

The App Store Connect API returns responses from resources that are consistent JSON data and contain links to additional related resources. Use these relationships to navigate to the related resourcesâ€”for example, to find beta testers within specific beta groups in TestFlight. Apply filtering to requests on specific resources to refine the response.

## Authentication

All API calls require JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorization. You obtain keys to create the tokens from your organization's App Store Connect account. See the Authentication documentation for details on creating API keys and generating tokens.

## Getting Started

1. Create API keys in App Store Connect
2. Generate JWT tokens for API requests
3. Make requests to the API endpoints
4. Handle responses and errors appropriately

For detailed implementation guides, see the specific sections for Authentication, API endpoints, and Error Handling.
